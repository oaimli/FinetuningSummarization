# FinetuningSummarization

Fine-tuning large pretrained models for abstractive text summarization using own datasets, with [PyTorch-Lightning Trainer](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/common/trainer.html) and [Huggingface Trainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/trainer).

Models below have been finetuned in this repository:
